# 🐣Inspiration
This is a webapp basically for all kinds of people. As a student, we use calculator very often and we have been carrying the scientific calculator to where ever we go. But due to the pandemic, most of us would have left our calculators at the hostel. And looking at the situation where all our classes are conducted online but the requirement of the calculator has not changed, many are buying new calculators or borrowing from others. This webapp will help everyone, like students or any working professionals. This will help everyone.
